Apple disabled autoplay for videos.

> "Apple has made the decision to disable the automatic playing of video on iOS devices, through both script and attribute implementations.

> In Safari, on iOS (for all devices, including iPad), where the user may be on a cellular network and be charged per data unit, preload and auto-play are disabled. No data is loaded until the user initiates it."
